Mediatek mt6397 regulator

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,mt6397"
- regulators: This is the list of child nodes that specify the regulator
  initialization data for defined regulators. The definition for each of these
  nodes is defined using the standard binding for regulators found at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

Example:

	pmic {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6397";

		regulators {

			mt6397_vpca15_reg: buck_vpca15 {
				regulator-name = "vpca15";
				regulator-min-microvolt = < 700000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1493750>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};

			mt6397_vgp4_reg: ldo_vgp4 {
				regulator-name = "vgp4";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
			};
		};
	};
